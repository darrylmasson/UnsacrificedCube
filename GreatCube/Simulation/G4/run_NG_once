#*This file defines one run action to be performed on an individual file*
#*produced  in the listfile. Specifically the MC code to be used in Ln15*
#*and the processing code to be used in Ln16. It takes  input as defined*
#*in Ln72 of the list file.                                             *
#*                                                                      *
#*$1 is the output file to be produced by the code                      *
#*$2 is the number of events to simulate                                *
#*$3 is the input file to be used by the procesisng code                * 
#*                                                                      *
#*Additional input have to do with the processing code being used and   *
#*should be adjusted accordingly.                                       *
